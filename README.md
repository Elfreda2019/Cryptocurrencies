# Cryptocurrencies

####
A cryptocurrency as a digital currency, which is an alternative form of payment created using
encryption algorithms. The use of encryption technologies means that cryptocurrencies function
both as a currency and as a virtual accounting system.

####
The purpose of this analysis is to generate a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are
on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system
for a new investment. I used unsupervised machine learning algorithm in particular the
KMeans cluster algorithm. In practice the types of cryptocurrency is grouped in four
categories, namely utility, payment, security and stablecoins.

####
A cryptocurrency data obtained from CryptoCompare was used for the analysis
Results: Principal Components Analysis was used to reduce the dimensionality of the
crypto data after data preprocessing. Three PCA’s were chosen as inputs for the
KMeans cluster algorithm. Four(4) clusters were selected based on the Elbow curve
using inertia.

####
In summary, some cryptocurrencies behave similarly at different algorithms during
trading. The Bit Torrent coin were supplied most with most mined. Turtle coin was fully
supplied on the market but had lowered trading
